![About Me Pic](https://i.imgur.com/KmwcKGd.jpg)

I am currently a first year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell. I completed my undergraduate education at New York University in 2022, where I received a BA with High Honors in Linguistics with a minor in Spanish.

My research interests are in the areas of bilingual syntax, syntax and morphology, syntactic variation, and computational linguistics. My undergraduate Honors Thesis investigated the agreement patterns of codeswitched utterances containing one-substitution and noun phrase ellipsis in Spanish-English bilingual speech.

When I'm not studying linguistics, I enjoy reading fantasy, training for triathlons, and getting frustrated at video games.
